# Comparable Solar System
A redo of the Kerbal Space Program stock solar system that makes the planets/moons (mostly orbital elements) more similar to the real solar system, but maintaining the stock flavor.

## Current Solar System Features
* All plentary bodies orbits are inclined to simulate a 23.4° axial tilt for Kerbin, similar to how Real Solar System does it.
* Semi-major axis and eccentricities for all planets adjusted to be, proportionally, identical to their real life counterparts. Exception is Eeloo's semi-major axis, which is in a 2:3 resonance with Jool, same as how Pluto is with Neptune.
* Bodies' sizes and mass retain stock values, except for Sun, Mun, Dres, Jool.
* The Sun's size and mass is proportionally identical to the real Sun.
* The Mun's size, mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity are proportionally identical to the Moon. This results in a slightly smaller Mun, but further away.
* Minmus is more inclined and is more distant since the Mun now orbits close to Minmus's original orbit.
* Dres has been proportionally resized to Ceres without any adjustments to the PQS. The result is a spherical, but jagged planetoid with interesting craters and mountains.
* Jool is proportionally the same size and mass as Jupiter. This results in a larger gravity well that will prove to be a challenge to escape once in it.
* Laythe is proportionally the same distance to Jool as Io is to Jool.
* Laythe, Vall and Tylo are in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance just as Io, Europa and Ganymede are.
* Pol and Bop's orbits adjusted to be more distant since the inner three Joolian moons are further out.

## Other Features
* KSC moved to a latitude of 28.608389° N.
